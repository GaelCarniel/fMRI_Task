# **Mission Briefing: Quantum Alignment Task**

**Welcome aboard, Mechanist!**\
You’ve been selected to undertake a crucial mission in our spaceship's alignment module. Your task is to ensure the quantum gabors are aligned to maintain the stability of our flight path. Follow these instructions carefully to make accurate judgments.

### **Instructions**

1.  **Alignment Check**
    -   You will be presented with two quantum patches.
    -   Your task is to determine if these two patches are **aligned** or **misaligned**.
    -   Look closely, as your decision here is essential for our spatial progression.
2.  **Sampling Crew Insights**
    -   If you’re unsure, you may **sample up to 3 fellow crew members** for their opinions:
        -   You will be presented 2 members of your crew with their confidence about their answer (full dot: confident, empty dot: low confidence)
        -   **Press** **'A'** to select the **left one**, **Press** **‘R’** to select the **right one**, **Press** **‘Z’** or **‘E’** to **stop sampling**.
    -   Each crew member's opinion is based on their own confidence assessment, so select wisely.
    -   To choose a crew member, you can consider how accurate they were in similar past tasks.
3.  **Review and Adjust Your Judgment**
    -   After consulting your selected crew members, you will have the opportunity to **review and possibly adjust** your original judgment.
    -   Use the feedback wisely to ensure the quantum patches are aligned and learn about your crew-mates reliability.
4.  **Crew Recall Task**
    -   At the end of the round, an avatar of a crew member will appear.
    -   **Press ‘R’** if you remember seeing this crew member during your current round.
    -   **Press ‘A’** if you haven't seen this crew member in this round.
    -   **Press ‘Z’** or **‘E’** if this crew member is not part of your designated crew.

### **Good Luck, Mechanist!**

-   This phase will help you sharpen your skills before moving into the full task.
-   Focus on distinguishing between aligned and misaligned patches; this will be crucial in your main mission.

### **2. Crew Introduction: Meet Your Team**
